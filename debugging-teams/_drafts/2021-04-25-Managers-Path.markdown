This is a new series, where I will be discussing a topic based on a book. It will be started off with non-technical books, as I believe a successful software engineer would put the same effort, if not more, in learning the social aspect of software development, compared to learning the technical aspect.

- Debugging Teams
- Amusing Ourselves to Death

## The Manager's Path

Congratulations! You have landed your first job as a software developer. You are energetic and very keen to solve real world problems. You might already have been furiously crafting the best code and possibly delivered few applications to user.

Slowly but surely you have built a good reputation, that you can turn ideas to reality. You start getting more freedom into how you do things. You have opinions on how certain features should work. You crank out features after features at truly astonishing rate.

Your work has inspired your manager to pursue bigger work that were deemed too difficult previously. So you start assemble a team to tackle the problem. You managed to pull it off too.

Let's take a deep breath.

**Now you just found yourself working with hundreds of developer.**

## There Are Many Missing Pieces

I believe the story could happen to some individuals, but it is more often to see a junior developer struggling without help, without a clear path going forward. Things would be much harder if said developer is the sole developer in a company.

How does the organization charts looks like?
	Who should do what ?
	- junior 
	- senior 
	- manager 
	- CTO

Do you get the support you need to success
	- Manager involvement 
	- Relationship
		Between You and Your Mentor, Leader, Manager






Completed after landing the first job
“Just want to build stuffs”

What drive you ?

## 

PRD,
1 on 1
Learning Relationship

## Different Task 

- Manage a Project
- Manage a Product
- Team Culture

Notice when you given certain responsibilities
It might stress you out because it is a hard problem, or simply out of your control
I.e. company culture / strategy / Project goal , metric for success
 
Setting expectation , communicate with your manager 
Collaboration and work towards that goal.
