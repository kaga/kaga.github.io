![The Manager's Path](/assets/book/the-managers-path.jpg)



This is a new series, where I will be discussing a topic based on a book. It will be started off with non-technical books, as I believe a successful software engineer would put the same effort, if not more, in learning the social aspect of software development, compared to learning the technical aspect.

- The Manager’s Path [ You are here ]
- Debugging Teams
- Amusing Ourselves to Death

## The Manager's Path

Congratulations! You have landed your first job as a software developer. You are energetic and very keen to solve real world problems. You might already have been furiously crafting the best code and possibly delivered few applications to user.

Slowly but surely you have built a good reputation, that you can turn ideas to reality. You start getting more freedom into how you do things. You have opinions on how certain features should work. You crank out features after features at truly astonishing rate.

Your work has inspired your manager to pursue bigger work that were deemed too difficult previously. So you start assemble a team to tackle the problem. You managed to pull it off too.

Let's take a deep breath.

**Now you just found yourself working with hundreds of developer.**

## There Are Many Missing Pieces

I believe the story could happen to some individuals, but it is more often to see a junior developer struggling without help, without a clear path going forward. Things would be much harder if said developer is the sole developer in a company.

How does the organization charts looks like?
	Who should do what ?
	- junior 
	- senior 
	- manager 
	- CTO

Do you get the support you need to success
	- Manager involvement 
	- Relationship
		Between You and Your Mentor, Leader, Manager






Completed after landing the first job
“Just want to build stuffs”

What drive you ?

## 

PRD,
1 on 1
Learning Relationship

## Different Task 

- Manage a Project
- Manage a Product
- Team Culture

Notice when you given certain responsibilities
It might stress you out because it is a hard problem, or simply out of your control
I.e. company culture / strategy / Project goal , metric for success
 
Setting expectation , communicate with your manager 
Collaboration and work towards that goal.

In software development, I believe this industry has been spending far more resources on the technical aspect of building a software. Some focus on the language feature, or the framework to build applications. While others focus on algorithms and pattern. It is also common to for companies to look for **geeks**, **genious developer**, with the selection critiea purely focusing on knowing exactly the technologies that the company is currently using and the ability to type code as fast as possible.

This is a new series, where I will be discussing the software development world that outside writing code. In my opinion, the human aspect and the communication between different parties are as important, if not more important than simply being technical excellence. Every topic were inspired by a book, which I hope my discussion could trigger enough curiousity to read the book and get the full picture.

## Paint a picture of the career progression.

## You are in control

The story above rarely happens, because 




Purpose	/ Summary of this Series
- Believe communication in software development is 
	- Too much alpha geek create a culture of fear
	- Give an idea what the book is about
	- Make reading an interesting 

Definition Manager 
	- Someone you report to
	- May or may not be your actual manager in organization chart 
	- Senior 
	- Team lead

You are in control 
You can't control how your manager should have known / reaction
- But you can take initiative to communticate what you want 
- But it will be a mistake to assume it is 

I thought I knew what is coming 
"Didn't aware what is ahead of me at the time"


Healthy Relationship 
	- measurable success
	- Clear expectation 
	- remove 

Career Progression as a Software Developer
- There are taskes that are not coding much more impact on other duties
