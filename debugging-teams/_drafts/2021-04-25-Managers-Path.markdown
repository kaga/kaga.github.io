![The Manager's Path](/assets/book/the-managers-path.jpg)

In the tech industry, I think far more resources was put on the technical aspect of building a software. Some focus on the language features, or algorithms and pattern to write the most beautiful code.

It is also common to for companies to look for **guru**, **geeks**, **genius developer**, with selection criteria heavily focused on knowing obscure performance optimization language features or the ability to program as fast as possible. While I appreciate those skills, I believe there are much more a good developer should know beside writing code.

This is a new series, where I will be discussing different topics that I think as important as being technical excellence. Each topics were inspired by a book, which I think every developer should read.

## A Long Time Ago in a Galaxy Far, Far Away

Congratulations! You have landed your first job as a software developer. You are energetic and very keen to solve real world problems. You might already have been furiously crafting the best code and possibly delivered few applications to user.

Slowly but surely your reputation of turning ideas to reality starting to spread. You start getting more freedom into how you do things. You have opinions on how certain features should work. You crank out features after features at truly astonishing rate.

Your work has inspired your manager[^1] to pursue bigger work that were deemed too difficult previously. So you start assembling a team to tackle the problem. You managed to pull it off too.

Let's take a deep breath.

Now you just found yourself become a manager working with hundreds of developer.

## Software Development is not About Writing Code

The story shows there are many roles in an organization. There are senior engineers, tech leads, managers and CTO. Every roles focus on different areas of delivering great product to user.

Those "abstractions"[^2] are there to help the team focus on one thing, deliver values to user. It could be seemingly trivial tasks, from getting office chairs, replacing light bulbs, to setting the scene for more effective development process and the product roadmap.

Understanding and appreciating the processes in order to get your software into hand of user, will help delivering better software faster and construct a collaborative environment.

## You Are In Control



Progress to senior position
PRD / 1 on 1 - Measure success

be a senior software engineer and choose not to be a team lead.

I think this kind of decision should be a conscious one.

Your manager is not perfect and does not mind read.



You can't control how your manager should have known / reaction
- But you can take initiative to communticate what you want 
- But it will be a mistake to assume it is 

Notice when you given certain responsibilities
It might stress you out because it is a hard problem, or simply out of your control
I.e. company culture / strategy / Project goal , metric for success
 
Setting expectation , communicate with your manager 
Collaboration and work towards that goal.

get the support you need to success
	- Manager involvement
	- Relationship
		Between You and Your Mentor, Leader, Manager

via
PRD,
1 on 1
Learning Relationship

Healthy Relationship
	- measurable success
	- Clear expectation
	- remove
