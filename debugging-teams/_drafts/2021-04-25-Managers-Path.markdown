![The Manager's Path](/assets/book/the-managers-path.jpg)

The main motivation of starting this blog was recording number of topics I found helpful in my software development career. 

This is a new series, where I will be discussing a topic based on a book. 

- The Manager’s Path [ You are here ]
- Debugging Teams
- Amusing Ourselves to Death

I prefer not to focus on technical aspect software development, as a software engineer would have spend most of his/her university degree in technical work already. I would like to use this series to paint a picture that, pyscology and human interactions is big part of creating a successful software.

## The Manager's Path

- junior 
- senior 
- manager 
- CTO

Completed after landing the first job
“Just want to build stuffs”

What drive you ?

## Relationship 

Between You and Your Mentor, Leader, Manager

PRD,
1 on 1
Learning Relationship

## Different Task 

- Manage a Project
- Manage a Product
- Team Culture

Notice when you given certain responsibilities
It might stress you out because it is a hard problem, or simply out of your control
I.e. company culture / strategy / Project goal , metric for success
 
Setting expectation , communicate with your manager 
Collaboration and work towards that goal.
