> No man is an island entire of itself;

> if a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe is the less, as well as if a promontory were, as well as any manner of thy friends or of thine own were;
> any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind.
> And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee. - John Donne
