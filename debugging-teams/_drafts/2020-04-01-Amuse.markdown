Amusing Ourselves to Death and thoughts on Development 

This book was written by Neil Postman back in 1985. This is not a review or summary of it but some thoughts on how it is related to software development.

1. documentation
1. information action ratio, a bug report


Neil didn’t provide a solution 

Good vs evil 

Agile 是影響文化或只是反映文化？



The Medium is the Metaphor and Software Requirement 

1. Shared Drive MS Doc 
2. Pure UX Design 
3. 
4. Overview Document in Confluence 

Scroll through Facebook & Twitter 

Document an a Software Requirement 

UI Prototype as a Software Requirement 

 television has made the consumption of entertainment (as opposed to reason or rationality) more important than communication of information. Information, in television culture, is always entertaining.

攝影不表現「人」，只呈現「一個人」；不表現「樹」，只呈現「一棵樹」。

 卻可能變成表演即埸

Single hand drawing is the requirement

反復睇
思想的意義
多了思考

思想有取捨

選擇內容，對象

當大眾都受電視 / Social Media 文化影響時，
如何可以同時可以接受傳統 document 書寫

YouTube / Netflix

對理解和吸收失去耐性

媒體支配文化
真理可能只係文化 見

資訊行動比

requirement gathering 娛樂化

學習係痛苦的
