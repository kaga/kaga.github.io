In my first blog post in Github, we have revisited the "original" waterfall paper. This time I would like look at the present time and look at a recently popular software development methodology.

It was **Agile Software Development**.

I think the term **Agile** has been mystified into some magical solution to all problems.

Here is my attempt of explaining the term in the simplest way possible.

## We Want To Build The Right Product

The goal of **Agile** is delivering values to user.

A successful product should solves user's problem, while keeping it delightful to use. It should be reliable and ease to use. It should give the impression to user that the product is saving their time.

In the commercial world, a lot of software are regulatory application. It makes sure the user does not work extra long hours, or filing in the paperwork so they don't violate the regulation. A product done right will transform the dreadful experience, that everyone avoids, into something more palatable.

I have recently needed to apply for an extra license plate for my bike rack, which is an requirement in New Zealand[^1]. The system was very easy to use and the whole process took less than 5 minutes. The cost of applying the plate is very inexpensive too, $22.38 to be precise, compared to the possible 227x ( $5000 ) in infringement fines. So it simply does not make sense to not displaying the supplementary plate or used a hand-written license plate cardboard.

## Agile Is A Mindset

The philosophy of **Agile software development** believes through quick feedback cycles will help develop the right solution sooner. This agility of receiving **quick feedback cycles** happens at everything we do, everyday.

If unsure about the requirement, then get feedback from customer.

If unsure about a design or technical implementation, then get feedback from your peer developer.

Once the feedback was given, the critical part is taking action. It means changing the design or implementation to realign with customer requirement.

### Manifesto for Agile Software Development

> We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it.
>
> Through this work we have come to value:
>
> - Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
> - Working software over comprehensive documentation
> - Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
> - Responding to change over following a plan
>
> That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.
>

> |Ward Cunningham |Jon Kern |Dave Thomas |

Like most things with software development, the values of **Manifesto for Agile Software Development** are all evolves around human and the feedback cycles around those interactions. The only value that is possibility not self explanatory is **Working software over comprehensive documentation**, which according to Rebert C. Martin and my personal experience, consistently deliver software is the key to build relationships and help build the other 3 values.

## It is not a War Against Waterfall

```bash
     Agile ------------- Waterfall
```

Since the goal is about delivering the right solution, there are many ways to achieve that goal, and **Agile** is just **ONE OF THEM**. Demonize **Waterfall** will not help in achieving the goal, and it is a very **Anti-Agile** thing to do. Since **Agile** is about people and demonize the opposing side is counterproductive.

**Agile** and **Waterfall** can be considered as 2 opposing force, where **waterfall** is slightly more rigid, more documentation oriented.

But no one lives on either end of the extreme spectrum. Some will be leaning against the agile side, and some will be on the waterfall. Over the years, I drift betweens depending on number of factors and situations.

> Both Agile and Waterfall methodologies do not want **chaos**.

### The Dark Side Of Agile

It is common to misunderstood lack of requirements, or having rituals ( Kanban, Scrum, Daily Standup etc ) is Agile.

It is even scarier to use Agile as an weapon to deliver more work.

Ask customer the features , not how to solve problem

## The fear of Not Agile Enough



## Fear is The Path To The Dark Side


## Adjust Your Approach According To Situation


Takes a long time

in times where the team is start having knee-jerk reactions to customer feedback, then I would slow the team down by putting some processes in place. Sometimes a lot of simple problems can be avoided by thinking just 5 minutes longer.
