This post does **not** agile,
~~The Agile Manifesto~~
adopting "Agile" as if they are missing out

Agile Life

2 元對立
只有極端 Waterfall 或 Agile  

## Work Approach

> Work will build up

## Build the right product

### Agile or Waterfall as a way to manage work

for you and your team

It is a line

"agile" is not the only solution

You will get efficient building software, but it is not the reason

stress free environment at work

meta philosophy

make future change easier

### It is not about the tools ( Jira ), regular  or framework ( Scrum / Kanban )

### Waterfall

- Plan before Work
- When in doubt, think harder
- Longer feedback loop
- A Lot of Documentation

### Agile

- Plan as you work
  - but does mean no planning at all
- When in doubt, ask customer
- Shorter feedback loop
  - Change happens frequently
- Working software ( with optional documentation )

## Adjust your mindset according with situation

## Takes a long time
