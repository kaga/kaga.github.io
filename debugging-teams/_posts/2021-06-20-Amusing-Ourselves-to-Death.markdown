![Amusing Ourselves to Death](/assets/book/amusing-ourselves-to-death.jpg)

Software development involves a lot of reading and writing. In order to write a program, one must read the API documentation, sample code and more, before a single line of code is written. To be a good developer, one must write readable code that at least the future self could understand[^1].

Similar to [GOTO Book Club](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEx5khR4g7PJbSLmADahf0LOpTLifiCra), I will be discussing different areas of software development which inspired by a book. However, this is not a book review but hopefully spark your interest to join this book club.

## Receiving Information Everyday

The world that we are living in, is a very different world compared to 1980s, which was also very different than the world in 1850s. Books, Telegram, Newspaper and TV were the main source of information for most people. Today, it is Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and the like.

However, the modern day medium is not equivalent to the medium of yesteryear.  An Instagram post is mostly imagery, and there is very little description to understand the context better. Besides, most people do not read the description at all. Most people just keep scrolling.

> What was the last time you pause and read an lengthy social media post ?

## Receiving Information at Work

Surprisingly, software development teams in the modern days still heavily rely on reading and writing. Most company still use email to "get things done" and instant messaging to discuss matter privately.

There are issue tracking systems ( i.e. Jira ), which help the product team to record bugs to fix or feature to implement. There are Wikis ( i.e. Confluence ) to record architecture decisions and support note. For software development specific workflows. Pull request is mostly reading the code and the comments made by the developer.

All of the activities above involve a lot of reading and writing. Majority of those reading are not code either. There are a lot things has changed in the software industry, but this culture of reading and writing still remains.

There is such a huge contrast on the use of medium between work place and life. It is not hard to imagine that habits from the personal life presents at work. It is far too common to see someone scroll up and down a page, trying to search for certain keywords and jump to conclusion immediately.

## ~~The Solution~~

> Can serious national issues really be explored in any coherent, meaningful way in such a fragmented, attention-challenged environment?

I do not have a solution, but I am certain there is No Silver Bullet[^1]. However, there are few things that I thought [**Manifesto for Agile Software Development**](https://agilemanifesto.org/) was heading to the right direction. Heck, the document itself is the perfect example.

### Individuals and interactions  

It is very good have good paper trail for a conversion. 
Sometimes a problem could be solved by having a face to face conversation 

Meetings, Having an agenda

There is an even greater challenges for working from home 

### Working Software Over Comprehensive Documentation

Similar to skunk works[^2]

good software should help the user understand the world.

This kind of easy-to-use should reduce the need for certain documentation. 

At the same time,  

It seems counter-intuitive 

even more effort should be put into producing concise documentation

Deliberate, to grab attention

looking for solutions immediately 

Requirement

Not building up the arguments

When things do not work as expect, the bug report should be written in a way to maximize the [Information-action ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information%E2%80%93action_ratio)

3 bullets and call to action


## Conclusion

> A technology, in other words, is merely a machine. A medium is the social and intellectual environment a machine creates.

Pull Request

Resist the temptation to turn an environment for work and learning into entertainment.
