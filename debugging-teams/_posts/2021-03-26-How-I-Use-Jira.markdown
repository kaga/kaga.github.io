Continuation of building the development experience

I think there are enough discussions on the internet on why Atlassian's Jira is a bad product. This is not a justification why I think it is a good software, but how I used it for the last few years in a small team.

Jira As a Tool To Make Problem Obvious 

## Fix Bugs Not Track Bugs

> You don't track bugs in Jira, You fix it. NOW! - [James Coplien](https://youtu.be/ZrBQmIDdls4)

Jira was and still is considered as **"Issue tracking software"**, which manages and maintains lists of issues[^1].

I think there is a difference between using Jira to record new issues to reduce mental load, and using it as a landfill for system issues, user requested features. Huge amount of backlogs that probably never going to be deal with.

The backlogs should be ever decreasing, instead of increasing.


## Next-gen Jira

> Jira Software is the project management tool for agile teams - Atlassian

A lot of new features has been released in Jira for the last few years, and I think one of the most important change was the introduction of **Jira next-gen**. I would seriously recommend using it over the **classic Jira** on new and existing projects.



### "Problems" with Classic Jira

The **classical** Jira was very flexible, where a workflow can be tailored for each company. I don't think it is a **"problem"**, especially when the company is trying to transform their existing processes to a new tool. I would not think Jira would be as successful without this.

I think the main frustration towards Jira, comes from the tool revealing the pain points of current processes, in a way that excels and emails were never able to reveal. When the current processes were strictly enforced by the custom workflow, teams could found that it couldn't handle anything but the most common cases. In this case, changing an established process is going to be painful and difficult.

The **jira next-gen** remove those "flexibility", while empowering teams to become self-organizing and establish their own process.

* Too much setup / maintaince that it needs a job of its own

## A Home Page for Team

Similar to using Github as a collaboration platform on software implementation, a Jira project should be considered as a collaboration platform on product development. 

It should be the first page where the team use, to find information about the product. Such as documentation, current progress and up coming work planing.

### Road map

This is a place where I organize upcoming planned work, where each **Epic** entry is a feature that can spand between 1 to 8 weeks. I found it provide guidance to on what should be work on next. 

At first glace, it should provides a high level overview on what is completed and in-progress.

### Board

It doesn't matter if the team is running Kanban or Scrum. This is where the hard work of organizing in 


This is the very place where the details 


- Current task 
Status Overview on what task is in-progress, pending review or blocked by other dependency.



### Task

Notepad 



### Release 

It is a place that recorded all released applications, with relevant tasks linked to each version for future reference.

It is also a place to 
control release, which trigger Webhooks to Github streamlining the release process.



### Other external resources

Apart from having integration with Confluence, there are many external services a team use today. Rather than everyone maintain their own set of bookmarks. 
Jira 

* Company Internal Portal
* Product Analytic Service ( MixPanel, Firebase etc )

## 

I think 

open for all to access 


It might be too overhelming to them at first, 

## Dark Side of Jira

Every tools has its limitation, 

apart from the dark hole for issues 

### Documenting Requirement 

### Story vs Bug vs Task Definition 

> It is a feature, not a bug

You can 

### processes and tools over Individuals

### It is Not For Your Team Only

There is also a management factor, where the Jira was use monitor project progress.

and lack of trust to empower self-organizing teams

it was used as a way to micromanagement

Jira can also easily become a place where issue is only recognized after it has been logged in 

* Invites Micro-management
    Process
* Process over human interaction
* manifest of existing process
