One of the secrets to build a successful software, apart from technical compentence, is the ability to understand the business domains and design the software around it. With the pursuit of getting every aspect of our lives more efficient and convineant, more and more enterprises are has find ways to better understand their customer and the market better, as well as improving their processes.   

There are many ways to obtain the knowledge, such as being specialised in the industry ( i.e. Retail, Geospatial ). Alternatively, collaboration with the customer and responding to changes as the requirements are better understood, as declared in the Agile Manifesto, are perfectly viable ways too. 

It is not surprising to see companies to adopt some form of Agile in recent years, certainly in the coming years.

## Continous Delivery is the Next Agile 

While what was written in the Agile Manifesto is simple and elgant, the real world could not be further from it. Some companies only adopt Agile by name and keep doing the same chaotic way of working. Some compaines took an highly structured approach where they follow a framework, such as Scrum, and follow the ceremones exactly as written on the literature. Very few would see Agile as a synonum of flexable working, as a mindset change.

The adoption of Agile varies a lot, most would certainly see some positive impacts in terms of better software. However, what were often not mentioned  the time it takes to see the first sign of improvements and the manitutde of the improvements. A system that used to be fragile and required months of manual testing, tranformed into a stable and ability to provide new values to customer once very month, could be considered as a successfull transformation 5 or 10 years ago. 



more and more systems  



 but certainly not high performance 




Agile / Flexable 
agile is not the only way to build software
Better software, faster 
definition of high performance do change, what is best few years ago are no longer good enough
Governments Traditionally view as "waterfall" 

## Approach Software Product Development In Scientific Way
    - "The common sense engineer" anti pattern ( The customer has to understand us )
    - Total mindset change

- Science of Feedback vs Cargo Culture 
- SAFe
- DevOps metrics as a way to review Agile practices 
- Team Culture - Learning Environment 

### Myth
- Not speed vs stability
- System type does not matter
