## Software Development is a Creative Process

Developing a piece software is very much a creative process. Some programs are invented because the programmer encountered a bad experience and decided there is a better way. There are also programs solving a problem with creative solutions as well.

There are techniques to come up with solutions to a problem. There are [pair programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming) but sometimes I just leave it in back of my mind, the brain will surprise me with a solution the next day.

On top of all that, the developer has to write the software for easy to read and understand as well. Once a particular part of a software is written, the developers will spent most of their time reading and understanding the source code, and only small portion of the time modifying it[^1].

Software development is so much of a creative activities, that in my opinion, it should be regarded the same as any craftsmanship, just like hand built supercar in the automotive industry. The developer has pride in crafting the most elegant solution.

## Software Development is a Team Sport

> Writing software is a team sport, and we posit that the human factors involved have as much influence on the outcome as the technical factors.

For simple program, it is possible for a single developer to come up with an idea and write the software.

However, there is only so much a single person can do, especially when the software is a product, which involves much greater complexity[^2]. Besides developers, there are tech lead, product owner, testers, engineering manager and marketing in a team.

> Bus factor (noun): the number of people that need to get hit by a bus before your project is completely doomed.

It is obvious a if there is only 1 developer holding a specific knowledge about the product, the bus factor here would be 1. However, it is possible that a large project failed because it was the marketing guy that hit by the bus.

## Build Superstar Team, ~~Not Team of Superstars~~

> Geniuses still make mistakes, and having brilliant ideas and elite programming skills doesn't guarantee that your software will be a hit.

Therefore in many cases, having a team is unavoidable for building great software product.

There are many misconceptions in building a team.

Some would proceed hiring many "genius developer" or the "10x developer", which created a team of superstars. Everyone in the team mastered their craft but has strong personal ego and does not work well with others.

> There seems to be a sort of disease that strikes new managers where they forget about all the awful things their managers did to them and suddenly start doing these same things "manage" the people that report to them.

Micro manage

> Only by giving up some ego will you ever change directions and get exposed to new things. Again, it's about increasing humility and being willing to learn as much as teach.

a superstar team, where everyone complement each other and mastered the craft of **H**umility **R**espect **T**rust, is a stronger well-rounded team.

  may be an indivual task would take fast to complete and ultimately can deliver a better product.

## Conclusion

> You'll end up spending less energy dealing with people-related problems and more time writing great code.

Such environment does not created overnight

The Three Pillars, it cannot pick 2 and expect it will stay upright securely

protect your team from all the storm
