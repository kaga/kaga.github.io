## Series Review

This is the last post for a while for this book club. I started by expressing mordern software engineering requires a lot of reading and writing, even ironiclly it is the same industry that changed how people communicate for the worse. Nevertheless, conscious of different communication medium key to the success of what we do. 

I then expressed how software development is a craftmanship but also a team sport. Only by working as a team, we could achive a lot more.

In the last post, I expressed there are much more than "writing code" as a software engineer, that software is a service that you provide to your customer. In this post, I will be discussing a similar topic but it is more personal.

This happened to myself early in my career, and many software engineers that I have met over the years, that after few years of working, we all at a lost of what is the career path of a software engineer. 

There are more companys nowadays, such as dropbox, have a clear definition[^1]. However, there are much more companys have just simple 2-levels structure, one level for the out of collage, and became a "Senior Software Engineer" for those that have worked for few years. The senior positions often are not well defined, mostly driven by time or technical knowledge in your domains.    

Moreover, I was also horrified by the sea of non-technical managers, who knows little about project management and software engineering. They came up with unrealistic schedules and cared little about the team, or the project.

On the other hand, we also seen our former peers, who was a good developer, promoted to management level only to witness she is fully ocupied by endless meaningless meetings and project status reports.

## Being a ~Manager~ Leader Can Be Fun

> Developing a sense of ownership and authority for your own experiences at work, and not relying on your manager to set the entire tone for your relationship, is an important step in owning your career and workplace happiness.

I am not trying to argue management is more fun than being a indivual contributor writing code and everyone should be a manager, but I do see management when properly utilized could help everyone in the team be much more effective in building the right product, and overall more enjoyable work everyday.

Taking extra steps to start looking at a new feature from a product perspective, and questioning how it fits into the short and medium term product stralegies. I found this hoslistic way of thinking can help answer a lot of day to day questions. For example, if customer discovered an issue, how and when to resolve the issue became really clear. A mistake was found in the core parts of a program should be fixed with much more care and attention. A wrong architectial decision should be reviewed and addressed.

In other words, the experience of a software engineer, in my opinion is determined by how she can look at an issue at a higher level. Being a manager or team lead is not necessary means having more responsibilites, but rather different kind of responsibilies.  

## Don't Forget What You Do Best 

> If you don’t stay in the code, you risk making yourself technically obsolete too early in your career. You may be on a management career path, but that doesn’t mean that you should wash your hands of technical responsibilities. In fact, I mention specifically in my engineering lead job description that I expect managers at this level to implement small features and bug fixes.

After promoted to manager or tech lead because of this new gain perspective. In my opinion, it is very important to stay close to your roots, even few years in the management. 

While it is true being a tech lead and above are involved in some "abstractions tasks"[^2]. Those tasks can help your team focus on one thing - deliver values to user. It could be seemingly trivial tasks, from getting office chairs, replacing light bulbs. However, it does not mean departure to your technical skills and stop writing code altogether.

First of all, the ability to contribute to the project occationally will help understand the day to day frustrations, such as tools relibility, or workflow setup. For example, if a simple 1 hour change takes 3 months to get to the customer hands, or impossible to incorporate into a release at all. This information will help you determine how you could help and stay close to the team. Techique such as Trunk based development and continuous delivery mindset plays hand in hand with this management style.

Secondly, the quality of the code for the project will improve a lot because of your limited contributions as well. It is because in order for any occuicational or new contributors to work effectively, it is particular important everything has to be easy to understand and well documented.

## Pay It Forward

> I do not pretend to give such a deed; I only lend it to you. When you [...] meet with another honest Man in similar distress, you must pay me by lending this sum to him; enjoining him to discharge the debt by a like operation, when he shall be able, and shall meet with another opportunity. I hope it may thus go thro' many hands, before it meets with a knave that will stop its progress. This is a trick of mine for doing a deal of good with a little money. - Benjamin Franklin

Another aspect of taking a software engineer career to the next level is helping your peers, sometimes even managers, to see the lights at the end of the tunnel. It could in the form of having a warm onboarding[^3]. It could be having constructive purposeful 1-1 meetings, or start mentoring your team members who are struggling at work.

This is in my view much harder than architecting a solution, because it requires a lot of patient and time. However, this will defines your team's cluture, and your team effectiveness.
