I amire developer who can write performan eligate code, and interested in exploring the latest software framework trends or language features. However, there are so much more than being knowledgeable on certain technology stack. Skills such as working collaboratively in a team environment, and building relationship with user in requirement gathering and gathering feedbacks.

In my opinion, I believe a successful software developer one should put equal focus on social and technical aspect.

## Management ≠ Evil

As a software developer progress her career from a junior position to a senior position. Some might prefer being a senior software developer because that was what she would love to do. While others might prefer not promoting into management position simply because they were horrified by less-than-ideal managers.

They thought becoming a manager would mean departure to their technical skills and stop writing code.

There are many roles involved in an organization, that contribute in developing and delivering a product, in the name of 'manager' and 'CTO'. Some might focusing on the big pictures, while others ensure multiple projects will deliver on time. It does not mean the manager will stand behind your shoulders watching, but to provide guidance, mentorship, training and generally cares for your wellbeing.

## You Are In Control

One of the biggest lessons that I have learned over the years was that, there are no one but myself to be responsible for my own future. While there are good managers, who will inspire you and help you tremendously in your career, but they can only help so much and you will be doing bulk of the work. Your manager might recommand you to read a book or learn Test-Driven Development, but it is up to you to read and practice it.

### What is Your Ideal Way of Work?

> Do you prefer waiting your manager to assign tasks to you, or you prefer to have choice over which task to do?

One of my struggles as a team lead was picking a right task for a junior developer. I was very concerned if the task was too difficult, it might dents her confidence level. Conversely, if I pick an easy task, I fear that I might limit her growth as a developer.

> Do you prefer having a peer program with you all the time or enjoy work alone ?

Different developer has different style of working and there are no right way. Some prefer leaving them alone to figure out. Some prefer bounding off ideas but can manage to finish the work on her own. Some requires clear expectations. Some would like to do the task as a team.

Finding out which way help you accomptilsh the task

do you know what is happening around your team? Do you know what is happening around

[from the leader perspective]

- How work should assign to you
  - All Bug Fix no Feature ?!
  - What are your views
- From junior to become a senior developer
- What's your expectation from a manager

- 1 on 1 with your manager focusing on your goal

- PRD ( Having a goal ) is not necessary bad

- given certain responsibilities
  You can contribute in the success of that objective

Optional to be a manager

In the tech industry, I think far more resources was put on the technical aspect of building a software. Some focus on the language features, or algorithms and pattern to write the most beautiful code.

It is also common to for companies to look for **guru**, **geeks**, **genius developer**, with selection criteria heavily focused on

## A Long Time Ago in a Galaxy Far, Far Away

Congratulations! You have landed your first job as a software developer. You are energetic and very keen to solve real world problems. You might already have been furiously crafting the best code and possibly delivered few applications to user.

Slowly but surely your reputation of turning ideas to reality starting to spread. You start getting more freedom into how you do things. You have opinions on how certain features should work. You crank out features after features at truly astonishing rate.

Your work has inspired your manager[^1] to pursue bigger work that were deemed too difficult previously. So you start assembling a team to tackle the problem. You managed to pull it off too.

Let's take a deep breath.

Now you just found yourself become a manager working with hundreds of developer.

## Software Development is not About Writing Code

The story shows there are many roles in an organization. There are senior engineers, tech leads, managers and CTO. Every roles focus on different areas of delivering great product to user.

Those "abstractions"[^2] are there to help the team focus on one thing, deliver values to user. It could be seemingly trivial tasks, from getting office chairs, replacing light bulbs, to setting the scene for more effective development process and the product roadmap.

Understanding and appreciating the processes in order to get your software into hand of user, will help delivering better software faster and construct a collaborative environment.

## You Are In Control

Progress to senior position
PRD / 1 on 1 - Measure success

be a senior software engineer and choose not to be a team lead.

I think this kind of decision should be a conscious one.

Your manager is not perfect and does not mind read.

You can't control how your manager should have known / reaction

- But you can take initiative to communticate what you want
- But it will be a mistake to assume it is

It might stress you out because it is a hard problem, or simply out of your control
I.e. company culture / strategy / Project goal , metric for success

Setting expectation , communicate with your manager
Collaboration and work towards that goal.

get the support you need to success - Manager involvement - Relationship
Between You and Your Mentor, Leader, Manager

via
PRD,
1 on 1
Learning Relationship

Healthy Relationship - measurable success - Clear expectation - remove
