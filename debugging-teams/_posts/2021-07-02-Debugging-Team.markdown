> No man is an island entire of itself;
> every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main;
> if a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe is the less, as well as if a promontory were, as well as any manner of thy friends or of thine own were;
> any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind.
> And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee. - John Donne

In the previous post, I started this book club with talking about reading is a way to learn, and simply having a conversation would help with team members that struggle to read. This post I will be discussing further about team work.

## Software Development is a Creative Process

Developing a piece software is a creative process. It takes a creative mind to come up a solution to solve a problem. Many software are invented because the inventor encountered a bad experience and decided there is a better way.

When write the program, there are also enormous creativity to just make the software run a bit faster as well. Such as the use of software algorithms, specific usage of language features and frameworks.

Furthermore, there are different techniques to come up with solutions to a problem, such as [pair programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming) or sometimes I just leave it in back of my mind. The brain will surprise me with a solution the next day.

On top of all that, the developer has to write the software for easy to read and understand as well. Once a particular part of a software is written, the developer will spent most of her time reading and understanding the source code, and only small portion of the time modifying it[^1].

Software development is so much of a creative activities, that in my opinion, it should be well regarded as any other craftsmanship. The developer has the right to be pride of crafting the most elegant solution.

## Software Development is a Team Sport

> Writing software is a team sport, and we posit that the human factors involved have as much influence on the outcome as the technical factors.

There are many ways to express ones craftsmanship. For example in the automotive world, on one end of the spectrum, one could hand beating every single panel on her own, or having a team of talents using the latest technologies to deliver the "last analog supercar"[^2].

For computer program, it is possible for a single developer to come up with an idea and write the software all by herself. However, there is only so much a single person can do.aoe project that, do different jobs than writing code, but are equally important. Such as tech lead, product owner, testers, engineering manager and marketing.

Everyone in the team do different tasks so that developers can focus on writing great code[^4].

### Bus Factor (noun)

> the number of people that need to get hit by a bus before your project is completely doomed.

When the team get bigger and especially more developers come onboard. One common way to divide the work is having developer each working on specific areas of the product. For example, for a 2 developers scenario working in a client-server based application, one would work on the client side and the other work on the server side.  

In this case, it is obvious to everyone that, it will be a major problem when there is only 1 developer holding a specific knowledge about the product. The bus factor in this case would be 1. The developer might not literally hit by a bus, but she could be taking personal time off, sick days, or simply decided to retire.

It is very evident as well the solution to alleviate this situation by training one or more developers up to share the responsibility. However, it is very easy to put much of the emphasis on the individual software developer causing the apparent low bus factor, and overlooked the rest of the team. A project could fail because the marketing guy, who also has in depth knowledge about the customer, got "hit by the bus".

### Build a Superstar Team, ~~Not Team of Superstars~~

> Geniuses still make mistakes, and having brilliant ideas and elite programming skills doesn't guarantee that your software will be a hit.

Therefore in many cases, having a team is unavoidable for building great software product.

There are many misconceptions in building a team.

Some would proceed hiring many "genius developer" or the "10x developer", which created a team of superstars. Everyone in the team mastered their craft but has strong personal ego and does not work well with others.

> There seems to be a sort of disease that strikes new managers where they forget about all the awful things their managers did to them and suddenly start doing these same things "manage" the people that report to them.

Micro manage

> Only by giving up some ego will you ever change directions and get exposed to new things. Again, it's about increasing humility and being willing to learn as much as teach.

a superstar team, where everyone complement each other and mastered the craft of **H**umility **R**espect **T**rust, is a stronger well-rounded team.

may be an indivual task would take fast to complete and ultimately can deliver a better product.

## Conclusion

> You'll end up spending less energy dealing with people-related problems and more time writing great code.

Such environment does not created overnight
