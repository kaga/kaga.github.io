The first 2 parts of this series were a general view on how we work day to day, such as communicating a newly discovered issue with the product or writing a support note. This post will be focusing on the bigger picture, the software product itself.

## Programming System Product

> Finally, promotion of a program to a programming product requires its thorough documentation, so that any one may use it, fix it, and extend it. As a rule of thumb, I estimate that a programming product costs at least **three** times as much as a debugged program with the same function.  
> The programming systems product. This differs from the simple program in all of the above ways. It costs **nine** times as much. But it is the truly useful object, the intended product of most system programming efforts.

Starting a new project is an exiting opportunity. Sometimes the project is about change of company's direction, or replacing a 10 year-old solution. 

There are many things to consider before a single line code is written.
It is often to see younger software enginneer try to write software solve all problems and challenges 


Progress your career as more sensor software engineer
A sizeable feature
 the feature is valuable to customer
A rewrite of existing legacy mobile solution

Takes a lot more that just work on the solution
consideration:

- Building the Team
  - Size
  - Methodologies ?
  
- Architecture
  - Which part would be bought not built
- Technical
  - Choosing the right framework
- Communication
  - Documentation
  - Email -> MS Team or Slack

## Schedule

> when schedule slippage is recognized, the natural ( and traditional ) response is to add manpower. Like dousing a fire with gasoline, this makes matters worse, much worse. More fire requires more gasoline, and thus begins a regenerative cycle with ends in disaster.


  - To break down the delivery into small chunks
no esimation does not mean not having a scehdule

taking into account there are
- on going support issues
- sick day
- personal time off
- Training time
- Meeting
- New team member coming onboard

Monitoring the progress and updating the plan


Project
- A software product
