This is a continuation of my keyboard setup. 

Needless to say software engineering is an occupation that require a lot of typing on the keyboard, and the ability to type as efficient as possible will save countless hours. 

I learned to type Dvorak, was my one of the first few things to learn when I started an internship. I still think learning how to touch type is the most important skill a freshly graduated software engineer should learn in her first thing in a job if not done earlier. 

My first motivation for learning Dvorak was to reduce my wrist pain, or RSI. The common QWERTY layout is more tiring when typing for long hours and the constant Cut-Copy-Paste on the left hand is not erconomical.

## Learn Dvorak as a Way to Learn Touch Typing 

Most QWERTY user, who claim they can touch type. Are not really touch typing but using 

I was also in the firm believe that Dvorak was a superiour layout than QWERTY. 
After years of observation 
I found that Dvorak is not significantly faster than QWERTY user.
At least not fast enough that matters in real world

Because the layout is not printed on the key caps, there is no other choice but to learn Dvorak via Touch Typing.

I also find Dvorak layout is more programmer friendly than QWERTY


## Cons - Shortcuts 

Is now a 2 handed operation 

Cut Copy Paste
Close Windows 

Visual Studio Code + Command P

Dvorak Qwerty Not commanded 

Software support has been getting a lot better 

Most IDE, such as Visual Studio Code, Intellij 

## Use QWERTY on Mobile Device 

I don't find it necessary to switch the onscreen keyboard for Dvorak

## Learning 

https://learn.dvorak.nl/

Set aside some time every day to learn it 

Personal Choice

After all, if one could type at reasonable speed,
it is usually the thought process becomes the bottleneck 

Don't rearrange the keys

Disable language switch short cut
