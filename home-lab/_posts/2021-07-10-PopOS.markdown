> To System76, this is not a review blog but I am keen if you can send a THELIO MIRA for evaluation =)

In my new PC build series, a keen eye would notice I was using Windows 10 to benchmark the virtual machine. However, I have not use Microsoft Windows at home for a long time. Since last year ( 2020 ), I started using Pop!\_OS as my daily OS instead of MacOS. This will be my thoughts on Ubuntu favoured Linux as a Graphical Operating System for daily use.

## Pop!\_OS by System 76

> Pop!\_OS is an operating system for STEM and creative professionals who use their computer as a tool to discover and create. Unleash your potential on secure, reliable open source software. Based on your exceptional curiosity, we sense you have a lot of it.

There are many communities package Linux up with their preferred software and distribute to the world. [Pop!\_OS](https://pop.system76.com/) is similar. It is a Linux distribution, which first based on [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/). Pop!\_OS put their focus on consumer experience.

System 76 sell their own hardware as well, so you can rely on them if building a computer is not your interest, or the after-sales support is required.

## Things to Consider When Using Linux At Work

This post is obviously try to convince you to start using Linux at work. However, before you start downloading the installation image and get going. There are few things to look for to increase your chance of successful deployment.

### Company Policy

There are concerns for keeping the OS up-to-date to protect from security issues

Support team has to be knowledgeable to support

### Appropriate for Your Development Environment

I support using the right OS for the right job

Chrome Web Application
Confluence, Jira

Mac for iOS development
Windows for C#

Problem with
Microsoft Office, Adobe

### Use a 2nd Drive For Easy Fallback

> Tip: Disconnect the Windows drive before installation

It is always unconfor

For someone that never used Linux before
small incremental steps.

## My 1 year Experience

1 year experience
A bit of android development and weekend projects

recently upgraded from version 20.10 to 21.04

### Hardware Compatibility - "It just works!"

I started the PoP!\_OS experience with an Intel NUC ( [8i5BEH](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/126148/intel-nuc-kit-nuc8i5beh.html) ), which is very similar to System 76's mini lineup. WiFi and Bluetooth they just work after OS installation and no additional driver required. I compiled the [Android version of Signal](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android) and it seems to be performing identical ( 2:15 to compile) to Windows, if not better.

I don't have any connectivity issue with wireless headphone ( Sony WH-1000XM3 ). Even using Thunderbolt 3 connecting external GPU works out of the box too, albeit more friction than MacOS in my opinion.

Peripherals are plug and play too. There is no issue for using [Security Key](https://www.yubico.com/) at all. 4K or Ultra-wide monitor are supported out of the box and scaling perfectly.

There is one issue with Bluethooth keyboard & mice, where I have trouble waking the PC up after sleep. Luckily the keyboard supports USB connection and I used the USB dongle that come with the mice ( Logitech MX Master 3 ).

### Software

| Purpose       | Software                                   |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Browser       | Brave, Chrome                              |
| Development   | Visual Studio Code, Android Studio, Docker |
| Shell         | ZSH                                        |
| Git Client    | Github Desktop                             |
| Screenshot    | Fameshot                                   |
| App Store     | Snap, Pop Store                            |
| Backup        | Deja Dup                                   |
| Communication | Telegram, Discord                          |

Most of the software that I used daily can be accessed on a browser, such as Trello and Apple Music. For browser I start using [Brave](https://brave.com/) instead of Chrome.

I think One of the best feature of PoP!OS is its Windows Tiling. It is very easy to get those applications organized
with 21.04 update, it has even better support of having 3 columns layout

### Stability

In general, the system is stable for day to day use. There are some odd screen rendering artifact after using it for few weeks, but it can be resolved quickly with a reboot.
