![Pop!_0S Desktop]()

In my new PC build series, a keen eye would notice I was using Windows 10 to benchmark the virtual machine. However, I never use Microsoft Windows at home.

Since 2020, I started using Pop!\_OS
1 year experience
serious day to day software development
recently upgrade to Pop!\_OS 21.04

I support using the right OS for the right job, rather than shoehorn.
Mac for iOS development
Windows for C#

## Pop!\_OS by System 76

It is based on Ubuntu
System 76 sell their own hardware as well with reasonable price and very compact

> To System76, this is not a review blog but I am keen if you can send a THELIO MIRA for evaluation =)

## Use It At Work

Use it at home ?

Problem with 
Microsoft Office, Adobe

### Hardware Compatibility - "It just works!"

I started the PoP!\_OS experience with an Intel NUC (8i5BEH), which is very similar to System 76's mini lineup. WiFi and Bluetooth they just work after OS installation and no additional driver required. I don't have any connectivity issue with wireless headphone ( Sony WH-1000XM3 ). Even using Thunderbolt 3 connecting external GPU works out of the box too, albeit more friction than MacOS in my opinion.

Peripherals are plug and play too. There is no issue for using [Security Key](https://www.yubico.com/) at all. 4K Monitor support are out of the box and scaling perfectly.

There is one issue with Bluethooth keyboard & mice, where I have trouble waking the PC up after sleep. Luckily the keyboard supports USB connection and I used the USB dongle that come with the mice ( Logitech MX Master 3 ).

### Software

| Software      | Purpose                                    |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Browser       | Brave, Chrome                              |
| Development   | Visual Studio Code, Android Studio, Docker |
| Shell         | ZSH                                        |
| Git Client    | Github Desktop                             |
| Screenshot    | Fameshot                                   |
| App Store     | Snap, Pop Store                            |
| Backup        | Deja Dup                                   |
| Communication | Telegram, Discord                          |

Most of the software that I used daily can be accessed on a browser, such as Trello and Apple Music. For browser I start using [Brave](https://brave.com/) instead of Chrome.

I think One of the best feature of PoP!OS is its Windows Tiling. It is very easy to get those applications organized
with 21.04 update, it has even better support of having 3 columns layout

### Stability

In general, the system is stable for day to day use. There are some odd screen rendering artifact after using it for few weeks, but it can be resolved quickly with a reboot.

### Performance

This is not specfic to Pop!\_OS but in

This is the time required on compile and run the Signel android app
