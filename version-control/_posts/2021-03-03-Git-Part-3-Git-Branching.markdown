This is the 3rd part on source control introduction.

* [Part 1 - Get Started]({% post_url version-control/2021-02-08-Git-Part-1-Get-Started %})
* [Part 2 - Git With Github]({% post_url version-control/2021-02-13-Git-Part-2-Collaboration %})
* [Part 3 - Git Branching (You are here)]({% post_url version-control/2021-03-03-Git-Part-3-Git-Branching %})
* Part 4 - Github Deep Dive
* Part 5 - How to Pull Request
* Part 6 - Git Tips

I found with Part 1 and Part 2 alone, which we have explored the basic usage of git and github, are suffice for starting out. The following parts are slightly more advance and beneficial working in a larger team environment.

## Branching `git checkout -b`

> Branching means you diverge from the main line of development and continue to do work without messing with that main line. [Git Branching - Branches in a Nutshell](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell)

In general, I would like to keep the **main** branch store the latest stable version of the code base.

It is a safe base where I can:

* experiment a feature
* a feature needs to wait for other features to complete
* concurrent development with one developer works on feature A, and another developer works on feature B
* represent the corresponding state in a multi-landscape architecture, such as SAP

```bash
                                                             
                                                             
                                                             
 +---+             +---+              Main             +---+ 
 |   |--------------   \--------------------------------   - 
 +--\+            /+---+-\                           -/+---+ 
     -\          /        -\                        /        
       -\  +---+/           -\+---+          +---+-/         
         --|   /              -  -------------   /           
           +---+              +---+          +---+           
                                                             
         Feature A                 Feature B                 
                                                             
                                                             
```

This is how a typical branching looks like, where **Feature A** is developed on a separate branch, and merge back to the **main** branch. In the graph, **Feature B** is started after **Feature A** completed, but it is possible to start **Feature A** and **Feature B** at the same time.

```bash
                                                             
+---+        Main         +---+       +---+                  
|   |---------------------|   |-------|   |                  
+---\                   -/+---+      /+---+                  
  \  ---\             -/            /                        
   \     ---\ +---+ -/             /                         
    \        --   -/              /                          
     \        +---+              /                           
      \     Feature A           /                            
       \                       /                             
        \                     /                              
         \+---+        +---+ /                               
          |   |--------+   |/                                
          +---+        +---+                                 
              Feature B                                      
                                                             
```

### Creating a Branch

```bash
âžœ  git-example git:(master) git checkout -b some-other-feature
Switched to a new branch 'some-other-feature'
```

> Tip - Put issue tracking reference, [such as jira reference](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/enable-smart-commits/), in a branch name to enable automation
> i.e. JIRA-123-Feature-A
>
> Tip - With Jira and BitBucket integration, you can create branch from Jira, with suggested name.

### How about larger feature

It is possible to create a branch based on a branch

```bash
                                                                                                   
                                                                                                   
+---+                                       Main                                              +---+
|   |------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   |
+--\+                                                                                      -/ +---+
    -\                                                                                  --/        
      -\ +---+      A Large Feature         +---+                               +---+ -/           
        --   --------------------------------   ---------------------------------   -/             
         +---+\                           -/+---+-\                          -/ +---+              
               -\                        /         \                      --/                      
                 \+---+           +---+-/           -\+---+       +---+ -/                         
                  -   -------------   /               -   ---------   -/                           
                  +---+           +---+               +---+       +---+                            
                        Feature A                         Feature B                                
                                                                                                   
                                                                                                   
                                                                                                   
```

## Merging `git merge`

Create a branch working on a feature means there is a point in time to bring it back to the **main** branch.

There is a way to merge using command line and github desktop, but using Github to do it is highly recommended.

### Merge Frequently

### Merge Conflict
