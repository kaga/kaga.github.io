It serves as a documentation for what the program is doing
It 
Helps creating a testable system




Build a system 
Little mess, but no big mess

### Single Assert Or Multiple Assertions Per Test?
 

1. build a system for long period of time
come back 6 months later and 


4 elements of simple design

1. Test
1. Minimize Duplication
1. Maximize Clarity
1. Small

"TDD isn't about testing"

~~The~~ 3 Stages of TDD
1. Not bugs (Mistakes) => Test first programming
    Reduce the time to discover mistakes
1. Design is the bottleneck
    - The cost of building new feature is sky high
    - Language
1. Patterns 
    - How test drive the design
    - These test signel those problems in the production code




it is not game
level 3 is better than level 2 is better than level 1

unit test to verify process, documentation
1 assertion per test
multiple assertions per test

Unit test

fast
does not depend on timing
does not depend on external system ( network, file system )

Zero integrated test to show the correctness of your code

When TDD is not applicable
- Tech spike


Reduce volitity in the marginal cost of features
