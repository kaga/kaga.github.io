## Myth - Code Coverage




## When TDD is not applicable

- Tech spike 





### Test Driven Design

#### Unit Test to help The Code Easier to Use ( Clarity )



## Big Design Up Front 

Test drive design decision

## Think Bigger - Modular Design

### Modular Systems to offload Responsibility

Unit Test Those Systems so you don't have to worry about it anymore

- Ease to use / integrate
- Abstraction / Hide Details

> Zero integrated test to show the correctness of your code


Helps creating a testable system


## 4 elements of simple design

1. Test
1. Minimize Duplication
1. Maximize Clarity
1. Small

Cost of maintain system over time
Reduce volatility in the marginal cost of features

## Integration Are a Scam



## TDD to solve Pattern Issue

    - How test drive the design
    - These test signal those problems in the production code

## Top down vs Bottom Up


### 

Problem - The code can't be tested

## 2. Refactoring

## 1. Design for usage

Writing test first

## Example

Formatter

Validator
Enum



A module was written, 
It is easy to substitute with different implementation, 
it has unit tested 
it is easy to use

It has some mistakes
- SQL injection
- Doesn't work well with multi thread
